This repository contains experiments for the complexity certification software package [ASCertain.jl](https://github.com/darnstrom/ASCertain.jl), reported in an addendum to the publication [A unifying complexity certification framework for active-set methods for convex quadratic programming](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9461599/). 

It also contains code that generated the front cover of the thesis "Real-Time Certified MPC: Reliable Active-Set QP Solvers".
